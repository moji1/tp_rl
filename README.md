# Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization: Online Appendix
This reposiroty contains the traning scripts, datasets, and experiments corrpsonding to our paper [Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01834.pdf)

## Datasets. 
The papers uses eight datasets that are placed in folder `data`. [Paint-Control]() and [IOFROL]() are simple datasets that contains only features related to the execution history of test cases. Simple datasets are adapoted from [previous work]() and the detailed description of the datasets can be found [here]().
We refer to the rest of datasets (e.g., [Codec]()) as enriched datasets since they include extra features related to the complexity metrics of the test cases' code. Enrcihed dataset are adopted from [previous work](). Table 1, Table 3, and Section 5.1 provide detailed information concerning enrchied datasets.
